1
00:00:02,491 --> 00:00:04,501
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:05,563
Who are you?

3
00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:11,271
Who? Who is but the form following the function
of what, and what I am is a man in a mask.

4
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,532
Well I can see that.

5
00:00:12,533 --> 00:00:15,634
Of course you can.
I'm not questioning your powers of observation,

6
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:20,174
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

7
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:22,175
Oh. Right.

8
00:00:22,176 --> 00:00:27,776
But on this most auspicious of nights,
permit me then, in lieu of the more commonplace soubriquet,

9
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,317
to suggest the character of this dramatis persona.

10
00:00:32,322 --> 00:00:40,826
Voilà! in view, a humble vaudevillian veteran,
cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate.

11
00:00:40,827 --> 00:00:47,359
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity,
is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,690
However, this valorous visitation of
a bygone vexation stands vivified,

13
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,551
and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin
vanguarding vice and vouchsafing

14
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:59,846
the violently vicious and voracious
violation of volition.

15
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:11,099
The only verdict is vengeance;
a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain,

16
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:16,594
for the value and veracity of such shall one day
vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.

17
00:01:19,403 --> 00:01:22,925
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose,

18
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:27,990
so let me simply add that it's my very good honor
to meet you and you may call me V.

19
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:32,233
Are you like a crazy person?

20
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:37,195
I am quite sure they will say so,
but to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?

21
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:39,494
I'm Evey.

22
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:42,732
Evey?
E-V. Of course you are.
