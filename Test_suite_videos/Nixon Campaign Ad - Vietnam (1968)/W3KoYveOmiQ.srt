1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,215
A Political Broadcast

2
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:13,083
Never has so much military, economic, and

3
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:18,861
diplomatic power been used so ineffectively
as in Vietnam.

4
00:00:20,106 --> 00:00:24,644
If after all of this time, and all of this
sacrifice, and all of this support,

5
00:00:24,663 --> 00:00:26,747
there is still no end in sight;

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,786
then I say the time has come for the

7
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:31,329
American people to turn to new leadership

8
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:36,023
not tied to the policies and mistakes
of the past.

9
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:43,953
I pledge to you, we shall have an
honorable end to the war in Vietnam.

10
00:00:48,941 --> 00:00:54,804
This time vote like your whole world
depended on it

11
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:56,090
Nixon

12
00:00:56,271 --> 00:00:59,893
The preceding political broadcast
was paid for by
the Nixon Agnew Campaign Committee.
