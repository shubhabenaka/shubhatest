00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,296
A Political Broadcast

2
00:00:03,894 --> 00:00:08,104
What has to be done, has to be done by
President and people together,

3
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,982
or it won't be done at all.

4
00:00:11,443 --> 00:00:14,209
I am asking not that you give something
to your country,

5
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:16,829
but that you do something with your country.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,872
I am asking not for your gifts,
but for your hand.

7
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,921
Together we can hardly fail.

8
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:47,318
For there is no force on earth to match the
will and spirit of the people of America.

9
00:00:54,232 --> 00:00:58,892
The preceding pre-recorded political broadcast
was paid for by the
Nixon-Agnew Victory Committee.
