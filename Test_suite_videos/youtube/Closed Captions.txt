[Herb, YouTuber]
This video demonstrates closed captions.

00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,000
To turn on captions, click on the icon over here.

[Greg, Deaf Singer]
Back when the Internet was first established, deaf people had a
great time with it.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,500
Everything was readable.
Then ...

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,200
[Ken, Deaf Listener]
Movies started showing up.
We couldn't understand them...

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,000
there were no captions!

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Fortunately, Google Video added support for captions.

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,500
Thank you, Ken!

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Now, we've added it to our app.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But the first thing he did with
that was RickRoll me!

[Franck, Icone de Mode]
Captions and subtitles are also helpful

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
for people who speak other languages, like myself.

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,000
With subtitles, I can enjoy US Comedy, or news stories from Russia,

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,500
in my own language. 

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
As a video uploader, this means you can reach
to people all over the world, 

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,500
irrespective of language.

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
[Hiroto, Bedhead]
You can upload multiple tracks like English and French, 

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,000
and viewers can choose the track they like.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
[Toliver, Japanese Learner]
For example, if you enjoy using YouTube in French,

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,500
French captions will automatically appear.

22
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,500
With just a single video,

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
you can now reach people all around the globe!

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The captioning capability at YouTube was just launched this summer,

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,000
and we're planning to add more features to this.

26
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,500
If you have any feedback, please let us know!
