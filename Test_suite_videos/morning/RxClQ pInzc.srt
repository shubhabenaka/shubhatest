1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:40,000
(Instrument)

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Watching the sun...watching it come

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Watching it come up over the rooftops

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Cloudy and warm...maybe a storm

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You can never quite tell from the morning

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And it's going to be a day

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There is really no way to say no to the morning

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes it's going to be a day

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
There is really nothing left to say but come on morning

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
(Instrument)

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Waiting for mail Maybe a tale

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:02,000
from an old friend or even a lover

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Sometimes there's none But we have fun 

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
thinking of all who might have written

15
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And it's going to be a day

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There is really no way to say no to the morning

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes it's going to be a day

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There is really nothing left to say but come on morning

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
(Instrument)

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And maybe there are seasons

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And maybe they change

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And maybe to love is not so strange

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:30,000
(Instrument)

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ooooooo......

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The sounds of the day

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now they hurry away

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Now they are gone until tomorrow

28
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
When day will break and you will wake

29
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And you will rake your hands across your eyes and realize

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That it's going to be a day

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There is really no way to say no to the morning

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes it's going to be a day

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
There is really nothing left to say but come on morning

34
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:52,000
(Instrument)

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:00,000
And maybe there are seasons 

36
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and maybe they change

37
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And maybe to love is not so strange

38
00:05:25,000 --> 00:06:02,000
(Music faded away...)
